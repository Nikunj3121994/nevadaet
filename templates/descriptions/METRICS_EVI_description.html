<h2>Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)</h2>
The Enhanced Vegetation Index is a common vegetation index that was developed to optimize the vegetation signal and improve the sensitivity to improve vegetation monitoring in through a de-coupling of the canopy background signal and atmosphere influences (Liu and Huete, 1995). Like NDVI drought can be visualized through computing time series and spatial anomalies of EVI.
