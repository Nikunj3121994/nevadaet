Record low temperatures were broken across most of eastern North America in 2015, a winter being dubbed as Polar Vortex II, a repeat from winter 2014. This frigid air has caused many climate change skeptics to say that global warming is over, meanwhile the warmest winter on record occurred across much of western North America. The cause of such east-west temperature dipole has been much debated, with ideas ranging from <a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/polar-vortex-whats-the-role-of-warming-18654" target="_blank">Arctic sea ice melt forcing wild dives in the jet stream</a>, to <a href="http://www.weatherwest.com/archives/tag/ridiculously-resilient-ridge" target="_blank">ridiculously resilient ridging across the west</a>. See this weather phenomena depicted in many different ways below.

LST</a>
- MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) difference from the climatology from January through March 2015 clearly shows this east-west dipole in land surface temperatures.  <br>

NDSI</a>
 - MODIS Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) difference from the climatology from February through March 2015.  Notice how all low elevations across the western North America show minimal to no snow cover compared to the long term average.<br>
