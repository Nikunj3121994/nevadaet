<h2>Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)</h2>
One of the first and most highly used drought indices is the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI; <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/drought/docs/palmer.pdf" target="_blank">Palmer 1965</a>), which is based on a simplified soil water balance and is a measure of the departure of average soil moisture conditions. Instead of the typical parameterization of PDSI using Thornthwaite temperature only  based potential ET, we utilize more physically based Penman-Monteith reference ET, which is a function of solar radiation, temperature, humidity and windspeed. A PDSI value between -.5 and 0.5 represents near normal soil moisture conditions, with positive/negative values representing wet/dry conditions. The magnitude of PDSI gives an indication as to the severity of the departure from normal conditions. PDSI> 4 represents very wet conditions, while PDSI<-4 represents an extreme drought.
