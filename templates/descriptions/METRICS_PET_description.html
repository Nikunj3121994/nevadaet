<h2>Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo)</h2>
Reference evapotranspiration represents ET from a well-watered idealized reference surface and is a function of solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, and windspeed. Reference ET is often considered an upper limit on actual ET.  Actual ET is usually estimated by scaling reference ET downward based on estimates of the fraction of reference ET (EToF) based on remotely sensed or simulated soil and vegetation moisture conditions, and vegetation type and phenology. ETo estimates in CLIM Engine are derived from the Penman-Monteith model under ambient meteorological and radiative conditions derived from meteorological reanalyses, gridMET (Abatzoglou, 2013). ETo assumes a reference surface of short grass (0.12 m high), completely shading the ground, specific albedo (0.23), and with a stomatal resistance rs of 70 s m-1 and aerodynamic resistance ra of 208/U2 sec m-1 (U2 is 2-m windspeed) (ASCE-EWRI, 2005; Allen et al., 1998).
